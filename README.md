###About
This is a fork and variation of the [HEY GIRL](http://heygirl.io) Chrome Extension.  However instead of replacing all the images on the page with Ryan Gosling, all the images on the page are replaced with photos of Bill Murray.

###How To Install
Download From Chrome Store:
[Link To The Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hey-bill/eiolimfoedapicedgmaiglcojfnccmak?utm_source=plus)
or

Clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/cbanowsky/heybill`

open up Chrome and go to settings (settings can also be accessed by typing chrome://settings in the URL bar).

In the left-hand menu click on 'Extensions'.  On the 'Extensions' page there is a checkbox that says 'Developer Mode'.  Make sure that is checked.

Now click 'Load Unpacked Extensions' and choose the folder in this repo called chrome_extension.

That is it.  Now you have Hey Bill installed and you can watch him dull up your screen.

###How To Use
* Click the icon featuring Bill Murray on any page you want to see the images replaced in.


The credit for this really goes to [Katherine Champagne](https://github.com/keccers) who created the original extension "Hey Girl".
